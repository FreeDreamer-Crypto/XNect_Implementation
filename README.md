# XNect_Implementation
Implementation for the paper "XNect: Real-time Multi-person 3D Human Pose Estimation with a Single RGB Camera".

Important Note: 

Our group had tried to implement this model several times but cannot reach the expected accuracy and result. 

After that, We had turned to implement another paper in order to finish our research.
